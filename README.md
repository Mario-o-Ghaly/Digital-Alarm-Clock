# Digital-Alarm-Clock
 ## Overview
 This is a Digital alarm clock implemented using Verilog HDL on Basys 3 FPGA Board. 

 This project was developed at the American University in Cairo during Fall 2022.

 ## Components & Techniques
 Some of the components and techniques used -- but not limited to --  are Finite state machines(Mealy & Moore), clock dividers, counters, rising edge detectors, debouncers, synchronizers,
push button detectors, BCD, and 7-segment display
